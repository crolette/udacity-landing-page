# udacity-landing-page
Repository for my second project by Udacity - Web Development courses. 
The purpose of this project was to take a first step in Javascript.

When the page is loaded, a Javascript function goes through the document and search all sections. For each section an id is created, then the navigation bar is created. 
On the page, the section is highlighted : in the menu and the section itself. 

Javascript:
- addEventListener
- intersectionObserver
- add/remove class
